Our final project for the Le Wagon Bootcamp is a prototype app for digital nomads, that enables them to search for experiences in new cities they are planning to move to, in order to maintain their routines and plan out their daily routes.

Users can select one of 8 categories in a city, and then browse each category, favoriting any experience, which will then be available on the routes page for users to create an itinerary.

On the routes page, users can use a draggable feature to order the experiences in order of how they want the itinerary to be created, choosing a start, middle and end-point.

At the moment the app is functional in two cities, Lisbon and Porto, with a mix of real-world locations as well as fake entries, created with random coordinates and using the Faker gem.

Sign-up is needed to view the app after the categories page, due to authentication with the gem devise.

App responsiveness for mobile and other desktop resolution is on its way.
